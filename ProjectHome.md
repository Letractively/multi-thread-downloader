Multi thread downloader is a download manager made for multi thread environment when more treads simultaneously can access to some restricted resources. Some web servers can have restrictions as how many connections can be opened in one time, how many documents can be downloaded in some time unit or how often manager can access to the server. Implementation count with all of these possible settings and tries to avoid conflicts or blocking from the server. For these reasons all downloads are put to the download queue and prioritised. Somebody can put a lot of links but it can wait, but somebody can put one or few links and needs them as soon as possible, because it will slow down application. Downloads are organised as packages where user can add links to download. For every server (regular expression for the URL) it is possible to set restriction settings and proxy servers (more proxy servers in the case when some of them is not accessible or application already used all possible connections).
